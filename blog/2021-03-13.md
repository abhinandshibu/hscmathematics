import IconExternalLink from '@theme/IconExternalLink';

This week I have added a [showcase](/latex/figures/showcase) of a bunch of different diagrams made using LaTeX.

In the showcase you can choose to download the diagrams as `.png` files or open them up in <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/"><nobr>Overleaf<IconExternalLink /></nobr></a> to see how the diagrams are drawn.
