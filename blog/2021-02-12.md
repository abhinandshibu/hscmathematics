This week I've have been adding some step-by-step guides for drawing diagrams and graphs using LaTeX.

<!--truncate-->

I've been asked by some colleagues how I make my diagrams that I use on the site and in documents I make at work. So I decided to add some guides to my site to explain how to use LaTeX for drawing diagrams and graph functions. This way they can refer back to it whenever they have questions.

You should see the new `LaTeX` button along the navigation bar and in the footer. Check it out if you have time, and if there is anything in particular you'd like me to add to the LaTeX section feel free to <a href="mailto:contact@hscmathematics.com">contact me<IconMail /></a>!
