Welcome to the site.

I am a mathematics teacher who decided to make a website to help students and teachers New South Wales with the HSC Mathematics courses.

**This year I'm planning on focusing on adding content for the Standard 2 course.**

I would love to get content for all the courses up by the end of the year, but I work full time and my students come first so I can only commit to uploading *something* each week. That *something* can include worksheets, slides, booklets, examples with video solutions and practice questions, past paper question solutions, etc. 

That's why I decided to include a blog as well. This allows me to write a brief post whenever I add more content so people don't need to go searching to find what has been added.

I have started by copying the syllabus for each course onto the site ordered by topic. I decided against breaking up the courses into year 11 and year 12 because in the end students are going to need to know all the content anyway and having the related topics together is more useful for students going through and revising in preparation for their exams.

Goodluck to all starting (or continuing) their HSC courses this year!
