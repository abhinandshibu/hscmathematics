[Right-angled trigonometry](/standard2/measurement/ms-m6/right-angled-trigonometry) completed (for now).

<!--truncate-->

Recently I have been busy with work and not had much time to work on the site beyond adding examples for [finding angles using right-angled trigonometry](/standard2/measurement/ms-m6/right-angled-trigonometry#finding-angles).

Next I will be working on some non-right-angled trigonometry.
