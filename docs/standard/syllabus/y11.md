### MS-A1 Formulae and Equations<a to="https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/11-12/stage-6-learning-areas/stage-6-mathematics/mathematics-standard-2017/content/1214"><IconExternalLink /></a>

* review substitution of numerical values into linear and non-linear algebraic expressions and equations
    * review evaluating the subject of a formula, given the value of other pronumerals in the formula
    * change the subject of a formula
    * solve problems involving formulae, including calculating distance, speed and time (with change of units of measurement as required) or calculating stopping distances of vehicles using a suitable formula
* develop and solve linear equations, including those derived from substituting values into a formula, or those developed from a word description
* calculate and interpret <Definition word={'blood alcohol content (BAC)'} definition={'Blood alcohol content measures the amount of alcohol present in the bloodstream, and may be used for legal purposes. -NESA'}/> based on drink consumption and body weight
    * use formulae, both in word form and algebraic form, to calculate an estimate for blood alcohol content $$(BAC)$$, including $$BAC_{Male} = \frac{10N−7.5H}{6.8M}$$ and $$BAC_{Female} = \frac{10N−7.5H}{5.5M}$$ where $$N$$ is the number of <Definition word={'standard drinks'} definition={'A drink that contains 10 grams of alcohol is called a standard drink. -NESA'}/> consumed, $$H$$ is the number of hours of drinking, and $$M$$ is the person’s weight in kilograms
    * determine the number of hours required for a person to stop consuming alcohol in order to reach zero BAC, eg using the formula $$\text{time}=\frac{BAC}{0.015}$$
    * describe limitations of methods estimating BAC
* calculate required medication dosages for children and adults from packets, given age or weight, using Fried’s, Young’s or Clark’s formula as appropriate
    * Fried’s formula: $$\text{Dosage for children 1 − 2 years} = \frac{\text{age (in months) }\times\text{ adult dosage}}{150}$$
    * Young’s formula: $$\text{Dosage for children 1 − 12 years} = \frac{\text{age of child (in years) }\times\text{ adult dosage}}{\text{age of child (in years) + 12}}$$
    * Clark’s formula: $$\text{Dosage} = \frac{\text{weight in kg }\times\text{ adult dosage}}{70}$$

### MS-A2 Linear Relationships
* model, analyse and solve problems involving linear relationships, including constructing a straight-line graph and interpreting features of a straight-line graph, including the gradient and intercepts
    * recognise that a <Definition word={'direct variation'} definition={'Two variables are in direct variation if one is a constant multiple of the other. This can be represented by the equation  y=kx, where k is the constant of variation (or proportion). Also known as direct proportion, it produces a linear graph through the origin. -NESA'}/> relationship produces a straight-line graph
    * determine a direct variation relationship from a written description, a straight-line graph passing through the origin, or a linear function in the form $$y=mx$$
    * review the linear function $$y=mx+c$$ and understand the geometrical significance of $$m$$ and $$c$$
    * recognise the gradient of a direct variation graph as the <Definition word={'constant of variation'} definition={'Also known as the constant of proportionality. See direct or inverse variation.'}/>
    * construct straight-line graphs both with and without the aid of technology
* construct and analyse a linear model, graphically or algebraically, to solve practical direct variation problems, including the cost of filling a car with fuel or a currency conversion graph
    * identify and evaluate the limitations of a linear model in a practical context
