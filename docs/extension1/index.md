##  Functions

### ME-F1 Further Work with Functions<span id="year-11">Year 11</span>

#### F1.1: Graphical relationships

* examine the relationship between the graph of $y=f(x)$ and the graph of $y=\frac{1}{f(x)}$ and hence sketch the graphs
* examine the relationship between the graph of $y=f(x)$ and the graphs of $y^2=f(x)$ and $y=\sqrt{f(x)}$ and hence sketch the graphs
* examine the relationship between the graph of $y=f(x)$ and the graphs of $y=\left|f(x)\right|$ and $y=f\left(\left|x\right|\right)$ and hence sketch the graphs
* examine the relationship between the graphs of $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$ and the graphs of $y=f(x)+g(x)$ and $y=f(x)g(x)$ and hence sketch the graphs
* apply knowledge of graphical relationships to solve problems in practical and abstract contexts

#### F1.2: Inequalities

* solve quadratic inequalities using both algebraic and graphical techniques
* solve inequalities involving rational expressions, including those with the unknown in the denominator
* solve absolute value inequalities of the form $\left|ax+b\right|\geq k$, $\left|ax+b\right|\leq k$, $\left|ax+b\right|< k$ and $\left|ax+b\right|>k$

#### F1.3: Inverse functions

* define the inverse relation of a function $y=f(x)$ to be the relation obtained by reversing all the ordered pairs of the function
