##  Functions

### ME-F1 Further Work with Functions<span id="year-11">Year 11</span>

#### F1.1: Graphical relationships

* examine the relationship between the graph of $y=f(x)$ and the graph of $y=\frac{1}{f(x)}$ and hence sketch the graphs
* examine the relationship between the graph of $y=f(x)$ and the graphs of $y^2=f(x)$ and $y=\sqrt{f(x)}$ and hence sketch the graphs
* examine the relationship between the graph of $y=f(x)$ and the graphs of $y=\left|f(x)\right|$ and $y=f\left(\left|x\right|\right)$ and hence sketch the graphs
* examine the relationship between the graphs of $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$ and the graphs of $y=f(x)+g(x)$ and $y=f(x)g(x)$ and hence sketch the graphs
* apply knowledge of graphical relationships to solve problems in practical and abstract contexts

#### F1.2: Inequalities

* solve quadratic inequalities using both algebraic and graphical techniques
* solve inequalities involving rational expressions, including those with the unknown in the denominator
* solve absolute value inequalities of the form $\left|ax+b\right|\geq k$, $\left|ax+b\right|\leq k$, $\left|ax+b\right|< k$ and $\left|ax+b\right|>k$

#### F1.3: Inverse functions

* define the inverse relation of a function $y=f(x)$ to be the relation obtained by reversing all the ordered pairs of the function
* examine and use the reflection property of the graph of a function and the graph of its inverse
    * understand why the graph of the inverse relation is obtained by reflecting the graph of the function in the line $y=x$
    * using the fact that this reflection exchanges horizontal and vertical lines, recognise that the horizontal line test can be used to determine whether the inverse relation of a function is again a function
* write the rule or rules for the inverse relation by exchanging $x$ and $y$ in the function rules, including any restrictions, and solve for $y$, if possible
* when the inverse relation is a function, use the notation $f^{-1}(x)$ and identify the relationships between the domains and ranges of $f(x)$ and $f^{-1}(x)$
* when the inverse relation is not a function, restrict the domain to obtain new functions that are one-to-one, and compare the effectiveness of different restrictions
* solve problems based on the relationship between a function and its inverse function using algebraic or graphical techniques

#### F1.4: Parametric form of a function or relation

* understand the concept of parametric representation and examine lines, parabolas and circles expressed in parametric form
    * understand that linear and quadratic functions, and circles can be expressed in either parametric form or Cartesian form
    * convert linear and quadratic functions, and circles from parametric form to Cartesian form and vice versa
    * sketch linear and quadratic functions, and circles expressed in parametric form

### ME-F2 Polynomials<span id="year-11">Year 11</span>

#### F2.1: Remainder and factor theorems

* define a general polynomial in one variable, ùë•, of degree ùëõ with real coefficients to be the expression: $a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0$, where $a_n\neq0$
    * understand and use terminology relating to polynomials including degree, leading term, leading coefficient and constant term
* use division of polynomials to express $P(x)$ in the form $P(x)=A(x).Q(x)+R(x)$ where $\text{deg}R(x)<\text{deg}A(x)$ and $A(x)$ is a linear or quadratic divisor, $Q(x)$ the quotient and $R(x)$ the remainder
    * review the process of division with remainders for integers
    * describe the process of division using the terms: dividend, divisor, quotient, remainder
* prove and apply the factor theorem and the remainder theorem for polynomials and hence solve simple polynomial equations

#### F2.2: Sums and products of roots of polynomials

* solve problems using the relationships between the roots and coefficients of quadratic, cubic and quartic equations
    * consider quadratic, cubic and quartic equations, and derive formulae as appropriate for the sums and products of roots in terms of the coefficients
* determine the multiplicity of a root of a polynomial equation
    * prove that if a polynomial equation of the form $P(x)=0$ has a root of multiplicity $r>1$, then $P'(x)=0$ has a root of multiplicity $r-1$
* graph a variety of polynomials and investigate the link between the root of a polynomial equation and the zero on the graph of the related polynomial function
    * examine the sign change of the function and shape of the graph either side of roots of varying multiplicity

## Trigonometric Functions

### ME-T1 Inverse Trigonometric Functions<span id="year-11">Year 11</span>

* define and use the inverse trigonometric functions
    * understand and use the notation $\arcsin x$ and $\sin^-1 x$ for the inverse function of $\sin x$ when $-\frac{\pi}{2}\leq x\leq\frac{\pi}{2}$ (and similarly for $\cos x$ and  $\tan x$) and understand when each notation might be appropriate to avoid confusion with the reciprocal functions
