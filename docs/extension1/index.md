### ME-F1 Further Work with Functions<span id="year-11">Year 11</span>

#### F1.3: Inverse functions

* define the inverse relation of a function $y=f(x)$ to be the relation obtained by reversing all the ordered pairs of the function
* examine and use the reflection property of the graph of a function and the graph of its inverse
    * understand why the graph of the inverse relation is obtained by reflecting the graph of the function in the line $y=x$
    * using the fact that this reflection exchanges horizontal and vertical lines, recognise that the horizontal line test can be used to determine whether the inverse relation of a function is again a function
* write the rule or rules for the inverse relation by exchanging $x$ and $y$ in the function rules, including any restrictions, and solve for $y$, if possible
* when the inverse relation is a function, use the notation $f^{-1}(x)$ and identify the relationships between the domains and ranges of $f(x)$ and $f^{-1}(x)$
* when the inverse relation is not a function, restrict the domain to obtain new functions that are one-to-one, and compare the effectiveness of different restrictions

    * use the convention of restricting the domain of $\sin x$ to $-\frac{\pi}{2}\leq x\leq\frac{\pi}{2}$, so the inverse function exists. The inverse of this restricted sine function is defined by: $y=\sin^{-1} x$, $-1\leq x\leq1$ and $-\frac{\pi}{2}\leq y\leq\frac{\pi}{2}$
    * use the convention of restricting the domain of $\cos x$ to $0\leq x\leq\pi$, so the inverse function exists. The inverse of this restricted cosine function is defined by: $y=\cos^{-1}x$, $-1\leq x\leq1$ and $0\leq y\leq\pi$
    * use the convention of restricting the domain of $\tan x$ to $-\frac{\pi}{2}<x<\frac{\pi}{2}$,so the inverse function exists. The inverse of this restricted tangent function is defined by: $y=\tan^{-1}x$, $x$ is a real number and $-\frac{\pi}{2}<y<\frac{\pi}{2}$

* prove and use the properties: $\sin^{-1}(-x)=-\sin^{-1}x$, $\cos^{-1}=\pi-\cos^{-1}x$, $\tan^{-1}(-x)=-\tan^{-1}x$ and $cos^{-1}x+\sin^{-1}x=\frac{\pi}{2}$
