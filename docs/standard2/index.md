* construct a network to represent the duration and interdependencies of activities that must be completed during a particular project, for example a student schedule, or preparing a meal
* given activity charts, prepare network diagrams and use critical path analysis to determine the minimum time for a project to be completed
    * use forward and backward scanning to determine the earliest starting time (EST) and latest starting time (LST) for each activity in the project
    * understand why the EST for an activity could be zero, and in what circumstances it would be greater than zero
    * calculate float times of non-critical activities
    * understand what is meant by critical path
    * use ESTs and LSTs to locate the critical path(s) for the project
* solve small-scale network flow problems, including the use of the 'maximum-flow minimum-cut' theorem, for example determining the maximum volume of oil that can flow through a network of pipes from an oil storage tank (the source) to a terminal (the sink)
    * convert information presented in a table into a network diagram
    * determine the flow capacity of a network and whether the flow is sufficient to meet the demand in various contexts
