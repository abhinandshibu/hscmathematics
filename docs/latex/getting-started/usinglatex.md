# Using LaTeX

There are two ways to get started using $\LaTeX$:
* Using an online editor such as <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/"><nobr>Overleaf<IconExternalLink /></nobr></a>.
* Installing it on your system.

:::note

Using $\LaTeX$ locally on your system will require a compiler and an editor. *guide to be added in future*
