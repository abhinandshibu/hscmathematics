## Proof

### MEX-P1 The Nature of Proof<a to="https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/11-12/stage-6-learning-areas/stage-6-mathematics/mathematics-extension-2-2017/content/2690"><IconExternalLink /></a><span id="year-12">Year 12</span>

* use the formal language of proof, including the terms <Definition word={'statement'} definition={'A statement is an assertion that can be true or false but not both.'}/>, implication, converse, negation and contrapositive
    * use the symbols for implication $(\implies)$, equivalence ($\iff$) and equality ($=$), demonstrating a clear understanding of the difference between them
    * use the phrases ‘for all’ ($\forall$), ‘if and only if’ (iff) and ‘there exists’ ($\exists$)
    * understand that a statement is equivalent to its contrapositive but that the converse of a true statement may not be true
* prove simple results involving numbers
* use proof by contradiction including proving the irrationality for numbers such as $\sqrt2$ and $\log_25$
* use examples and counter-examples
* prove results involving inequalities. For example:
    * prove inequalities by using the definition of $a>b$ for real $a$ and $b$
    * prove inequalities by using the property that squares of real numbers are non-negative
    * prove and use the triangle inequality $|x|+|y|\geq|x+y|$ and interpret the inequality geometrically
    * establish and use the relationship between the arithmetic mean and geometric mean for two non-negative numbers

* understand and use sigma notation to prove results for sums, for example:  
$\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^N\frac{1}{(2n+1)(2n-1)}=\frac{N}{2N+1}}$
* understand and prove results using mathematical induction, including inequalities and results in algebra, calculus, probability and geometry. For example:
    * prove inequality results, eg $2n>n^2$, for positive integers $n>4$
    * prove divisibility results, eg $3^{2n+4}-2^{2n}$ is divisible by 5 for any positive integer $n$
    * prove results in calculus, eg prove that for any positive integer $n$, $\frac{d}{dx}\left(x^n\right)=nx^{n-1}$
    * prove results related to probability, eg the binomial theorem:  
    $\displaystyle{(x+a)^n=\sum_{r=0}^n {}^nC_rx^{n-r}a^r}$
